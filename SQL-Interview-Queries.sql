-- Query 33
-- Write an SQL query to determine the nth (say n=5) highest salary from a table.
-- There are two ways of doing it:
-- Way 1 [by using the limit keyword And the Offset Keyword]
-- The 'OFFSET' argument is used to identify the starting point to return rows from a result set. Basically, it excludes the first set of records.
-- The 'limit' keyword would be restricting the number of rows that should be given as an output.
-- The value of the OFFSET Keyword is 'n-1', it means that to get the nth highest record, you wish to start printing the values from n-1th row as indexing starts from 0.

-- OR it can also be done by this

-- Way 2 [by using Correlated sub-query] Shown in the Query 34
-- Query 34
-- Write an SQL query to determine the 5th highest salary without using LIMIT keyword.

-- Query 35
-- Write an SQL query to fetch the list of employees with the same salary.
-- The below query [a default Inner Join] would also do the comparison of the employee with himself/herself but we don't want this.
SELECT * FROM 
Worker as w1 , Worker as w2 
WHERE w1.salary = w2.salary;

-- To improve on that, we'll make the IDs dissimilar so that the same workers are not compared

-- Query 37
-- Write an SQL query to show one row twice in results from a table. [Not a that useful query but it is useful in clearing the concept about Unions]
-- We know that When we take the 'Union' of two sets, we only get the Distinct values in the resulting set but to get all thos similar values in the resulting set we can use the 'UNION ALL' Clause - this would result in us getting those multiple values

-- Query 39
-- Write an SQL query to fetch the first 50% records from a table.
-- The worker table currently has 8 rows and we also know that the worker_id column is self-Incrementing therefore the actual ans would be where worker_id <= total count of worker ids in the table.
